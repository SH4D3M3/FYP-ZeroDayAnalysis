# FYP-ZeroDayAnalysis
Zero-day attacks are one of the most challenging cybersecurity threats, as they exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in software or systems, leaving little time for defenders to react. 
Traditional signature-based methods and even some machine learning approaches struggle to identify these attacks due to their novel nature. 
Deep learning techniques, with their ability to automatically learn complex patterns, offer a promising avenue for more effective zero-day attack detection.
The aim of this research is to leverage deep learning techniques to develop an effective solution for detecting zero-day attacks in real-time network traffic or system behavior. 
The goal is to create a model that can generalize from known attack patterns to identify new, previously unseen attack types with high accuracy and low false positive rates.
